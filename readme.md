# Crystal Selector Game
## GT Coding Bootcamp Homework #4
### Description:

This is a game that displays a target number that is randomly generated.

There are 4 crystals that have been assigned random values which are hidden from the player.

The player must click on the crystals to increment their total points and the object of the game is for the player to click on the correct sequence of crystals so that their total
score exactly equals the target number.

If the player exactly matches the target number then their wins total is incremented.

If the player's total score exceeds the target number then the player losses and their loss total is incremented.

If the player wins or loses then a new random number is generated for the target number, a new random value is generated for each crystal and the player's total score is reset to 0.
